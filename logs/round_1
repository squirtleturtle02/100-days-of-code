**Today's Progress**: ***

**Thoughts**: I am committing to 100 Days of code challenge. I currently work as a senior pension anaylyst and would love to make the steps to 
further myself and my career.

Some focuses:
Finish working through a basics of react course. https://www.udemy.com/share/101WbyB0oSdl1TRXg=/ 

Finish the FCC Front End Developer Certificate. 

Project IDeas: 
CRUD To do app / task manager. 

Gripe roulette - As a joke about gripes i hear from friends and family. It would be a fun project to compile it all into one location, press a button and have a random gripe show up.
